## Setup

### zsh

Loot at zsh/.example-zshenv and copy it to /etc/zsh/zshenv.


### Cholor schemes
I have a sane default color scheme, but to use the pretty color schemes that match tbe bg you need to install pywall. Then for discord and spotify you'll want to install [wal-discord](https://github.com/guglicap/wal-discord) and [pywal-spotify](https://gitlab.com/MisguidedEmails/pywal-spotify).
